# ServiceDesign - Project for HAMK Design Factory

The DF Service Design Summer Project, undertaken by team Diversified, addresses key challenges 
faced by Sampola, a workshop in Hämeenlinna that employs individuals with disabilities in producing 
a range of handcrafted and recycled products. Sponsored by Sampola and in collaboration with 
HAMK, our project aimed to expand the market for Sampola's products, improve raw material 
sourcing, enhance community engagement, and revamp their online presence. Through a structured 
service design approach, including co-creation, service blueprinting, and iterative testing, we 
developed strategic solutions to boost Sampola's market visibility, operational efficiency, and 
community impact. Our work culminated in a final presentation, showcasing the practical application 
of service design principles in addressing real-world challenges, thereby empowering Sampola to 
better achieve its social and economic goals.
